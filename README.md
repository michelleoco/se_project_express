## Introduction

**What To Wear (WTWR)** is a weather-based clothing recommendation application.  
This repository contains the **Express.js back-end** that powers the app, managing user accounts, clothing data, and personalized outfit suggestions based on local weather.

---

## Project Goals

- Build a secure and scalable back-end API to support the WTWR application.
- Enable authenticated users to store and manage their clothing items.
- Integrate weather-based outfit recommendations using real-time data.
- Ensure robust input validation, error handling, and security best practices.

## What Was Done

The project was developed with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, connected to a **MongoDB** database. Key steps included:

1. **API Development**

   - Designed RESTful endpoints for user authentication and clothing item management.
   - Implemented CRUD operations for clothing items.

2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - User sign-up/sign-in with secure password hashing using **Bcrypt**.
   - Token-based authentication with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.

3. **Weather Integration**

   - Processed location data to fetch weather conditions.
   - Generated personalized outfit suggestions.

4. **Validation & Error Handling**

   - Used **Celebrate/Joi** for request validation.
   - Centralized error handler for consistent API responses.

5. **Security & Code Quality**
   - Enforced coding standards with **ESLint**.
   - Implemented secure password storage and protected routes.
